        <p>Although all lessons are currently online due to the COVID 19 pandemic, local students will be able to be in-person once it is deemed safe. For distance learners, online lessons can continue indefinitely. But parents should realize that as with most online learning, their children will need a lot of support.</p>

        <h1> Required Materials</h1>
        <p> 
        For piano lessons, you need to have an acoustic piano in good playing condition or a full-sized digital piano with all eighty-eight keys. For flute lessons, you will need a flute in good playing condition.</p>
        
        <p>A good internet connection is necessary, and a device will be needed such as a tablet or laptop with Wi-Fi connection, a computer with a camera, or a smart phone. Lessons will be on a video calls and I have used various platforms, but I prefer Zoom or Skype  </p>
        <p> Keep in mind that I will make recommendations as to what method books, music, and other learning materials are needed and you will be expected to purchase these on your own. </p>
        <h2> Lesson Plan</h2>
        <p> Each online lesson will be forty-five minutes, once a week.  The student will have assigned pieces which they have been practicing and I will give feedback about what is going well, what needs more work, give instruction about how to practice, and discuss with the student their short and long term goals. </p>

        <h3>Lessons Goals</h3>
        <p>These goals for practice will be notated on the free app, Cadenza. The student will be able to communicate with me throughout the week using the app, also. In order to make good progress, the student will be expected to set goals for practicing and keep track of their practice throughout the week  </p>

        <h4>Before Enrollment</h4>
        <p> Before enrolling a prospective student, I find that a mutual interview via video call is helpful for the student, parents, and teacher. I will use this time to explain my method of teaching and policies.</p>
        
        <p>I will ask questions to understand more about the studentâ€™s interest in music and any previous music study. 
         At this time, the student and parents may share their goals and expectations and ask questions about what they can expect from me as their teacher.</p>
         
         <p>This meeting is free and there is no obligation to enroll. Please allow forty-five minutes of your time for this meeting. We can discuss scheduling of your lessons at that time, also. Each lesson will be at the same time once a week.</p>
