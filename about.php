          <p>I studied flute and piano in college and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in music education from the University of Arizona. Ever since, I have been teaching piano and flute in different settings- privately, at our local university, and more recently online.</p>
          
          
          <p>I use music of different periods and styles in order to add to the students’ versatility and increase their understanding of music history. I keep the students’ music preferences in mind. </p>
          
          <p>Students have the opportunity to learn chord progressions and ear training that enable them to improvise, play favorite tunes by ear, and compose their own music </p>
          
          <p>As students develop the skills, they need to reach their individual goals, I work to embolden each student with confidence by consistently reinforcing and praising their accomplishments. I encourage my students to perform and provide motivation with masterclasses, recitals, auditions, festivals, and contests.My ultimate goal for my students is that they will develop their own lifelong love of music!</p>
